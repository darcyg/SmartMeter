; A routine to filter away the DC content from an AC mains waveform
; signal. It does this my using a heavily damped integrator to estimate
; the DC level. The current DC level is then subtracted from the signal.

; One would like to estimate DC by something like:
;   z += ((((int32_t) x << 15) - z) >> 14);
;   return  x - (z >> 15);
; but this:
;   z += ((((int32_t) x << 16) - z) >> 14);
;   return  x - (z >> 16);
; is a bit faster, and the shift by 16 will never
; cause an overflow in this application. However,
; remember this is not a generic DC filter!
